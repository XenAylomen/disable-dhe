# webrtc-hide-local-address extension

(Hide local IP addresses from content using WebRTC in Firefox)[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/webrtc-hide-local-address/]

Useful if you wish to prevent websites from learning your local IP addresses
when you're behind a NAT. Also prevents the use of interfaces other than your
default. May prevent WebRTC calls from working over a local network with some
services.
